# hlt-speed-tweak

To use this script, first unzip your hlptrz file into the same directory as the script. Then edit the file to include your hlptrz filename, and the correction factor. You can find the correction factor by logging both GPS and OBD speeds at a steady speed. Then figure your correction factor by dividing GPS_SPEED/OBD_SPEED. Your GPS speed will typically be lower than your OBD speed.
